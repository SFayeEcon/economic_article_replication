# economic_article_replication
This project was conducted by several classmates and myself. We reproduced the following economic paper for our applied econometrics course: Angrist, J. D.; Krueger, A. B. (1991). Does Compulsory School Attendance Affect Schooling and Earnings? The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 106(4), 979â€“1014.
